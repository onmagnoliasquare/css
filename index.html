      About us</h2>
    <p class="archivo-oms measure lh-copy f5 f4-l container tracked-02">Beginning as a collaboration between the NYU Shanghai Writing Department and students of NYU Shanghai’s Inaugural Class,
    On Magnolia Square, formerly On Century Avenue, has bloomed into a thriving daily student publication. On Magnolia
    Square is written, staffed, and managed entirely by a dedicated group of NYU Shanghai undergraduate students, who come
    from more than twelve different countries. With an interest in editorial, visual, audio, and literary works, On Magnolia
    Square serves not only as a news source, but also as a platform for students to publish opinions and personal works.
    Though rooted within NYU Shanghai, On Magnolia Square serves a bigger audience with its focus on NYU’s Global Network
    and the vibrant city of Shanghai.</p>
