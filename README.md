# OMS CSS Tachyons Fork

CSS Tachyons fork for OMS website. This is our custom CSS for the On Magnolia Square website.

## Starting development

In order to start developing, you can use VS Code live server or npm live-server to see updates in real time.

First run `yarn start`, then start the live-server. This will then allow you to see the changes in real time.

## Why are there two repositories?

This enables CSS and HTML design prototyping, a non-destructive environment to observe the CSS changes in isolation.
