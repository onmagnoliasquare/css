# OMS CSS Tachyons Fork

CSS Tachyons fork for OMS website. This is our custom CSS for the On Magnolia Square website.

## Starting development

To start development:

In one terminal run `yarn start` and in another run `yarn dev`. The first command runs the build watching process to autobuild and update the CSS files in css accordingly. The second command starts the vite development server.

## Why are there two repositories?

This enables CSS and HTML design prototyping, a non-destructive environment to observe the CSS changes in isolation.
